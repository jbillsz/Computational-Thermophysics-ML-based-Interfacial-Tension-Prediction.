# Computational-Thermophysics-ML-based-Interfacial-Tension-Prediction.
A machine learning study on interfacial tension prediction using ensemble and deep learning methods.
This repository represents the foundation for subsequent work on CO‚ÇÇ solubility estimation, extending ML-based modeling of interfacial tension to broader thermophysical systems.

### üîç Explainable AI
Model interpretability was integrated using:
- Feature importance analysis (XGBoost, Extra Trees)
- SHAP/Permutation importance for deep models
- Williams plots for outlier detection and model reliability
